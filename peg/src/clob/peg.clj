(defn mknot
  "Create a rule that fails if the next input matches rule and

`mknot` inverts a rule. Given a rule, `mknot` returns a new
rule that fails when the given rule succeeds, and vice versa. It never
returns a value and never consumes input. It is most useful for making
a rule that says \"and is not followed by . . .\".

Example:

    (def not-followed-by-whitespace (mknot whitespace))
    (not-followed-by-whitespace \"abc\" {} {} {}) 
        => {:r nil :s [] :i (\\a \\b \\c) :b {} :m {})

(defn mkbind
  "Create a rule that binds the return value of rule to var.

`mkbind` creates a rule that will bind the return value of its first
argument (a rule) to its second argument (typically a
keyword). Binding is useful if you want to refer to the return value
of a rule later.

Example:

    ;; bind the matched digits to :digits

(defn mkpr
  "Create a rule that consumes one item from the input. If pr applied
to that item returns true, the rule succeeds. Otherwise, fail.

`mkpr` creates a rule that consumes one item from the input. It then
calls the given predicate on it. If the predicate returns nil, the
rule fails. Otherwise, the rule passes. The return value is the item
consumed. (It does not consume input if the predicate fails.)

Example:

    ;; match only even numbers
